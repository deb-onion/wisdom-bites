Also fixed CSS compatibility issues and accessibility problems.
v3.0.1 (2025-03-04): Fixed virtual tour location accuracy: The Street View was loading random locations instead of the clinic because the code was using a suboptimal location search method. Modified initStreetView() to prioritize Place ID-based lookup (which provides exact matching) rather than relying on coordinate-based search. Added a two-tier initialization approach with better error handling and logging to ensure visitors see the actual clinic location at 1/4A, North Road, Poddar Nagar, Jadavpur, Kolkata.
v3.0.2 (2025-03-04): Fixed virtual tour location accuracy: The Street View was loading at 'Staff Canteen (Aahar Canteen)' instead of the dental clinic due to imprecise coordinates (22.4969, 88.3722) and suboptimal Google Maps Street View initialization. Updated to exact clinic coordinates (22.496391851463255, 88.36915472944189), implemented a three-tier Street View initialization approach that prioritizes Place ID-based lookup, and added helpful navigation prompts and extensive error logging. This ensures visitors see the actual Wisdom Bites Dental Clinic at 1/4A, North Road, Poddar Nagar, Jadavpur, Kolkata.
v3.0.3 (2025-03-04): Ensured all tour fallbacks use exact clinic location data: Replaced the Static Map API fallback with the embedded Google Maps iframe for reliability, updated clinic data with precise coordinates (22.496391851463255, 88.36915472944189), and ensured all fallback mechanisms refer specifically to Wisdom Bites Dental Clinic at 1/4A, North Road, Poddar Nagar, Jadavpur, Kolkata. Added better styling for embedded maps and updated clinic service information.
v3.0.4 (2025-03-04): Fixed virtual tour Street View location issue: Implemented direct panorama ID targeting (fGMVDjDFNHlkGsTF-HuMoQ) to ensure the virtual tour always opens at Wisdom Bites Dental Clinic instead of 'Excellent Tutorial'.
